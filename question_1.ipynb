            "Order NowMUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will inject liquidity of Rs 30,000 crore through open market operations next week to maintain financial stability in the system in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.The RBI has decided to conduct purchase of government securities under open market operations (OMOs) for an aggregate amount of Rs 30,000 crore in two tranches of Rs 15,000 crore each in March, the central bank said in a statement.The auctions would be conducted on March 24 and March 30, it said.It said, \"With the COVID-19 related dislocations, stress in certain financial market segments is still severe and financial conditions remain tight.\n",
            "The RBI's endeavour is to ensure that all markets segments function normally with adequate liquidity and turnover.\n",
            "\"The central bank infused Rs 10,000 crore through open market operations on Friday.It will purchase securities with a coupon rate of 6.84 per cent (maturity December 19, 2022); 7.72 per cent (May 25, 2025); 8.33 per cent (July 9, 2026) and 7.26 per cent (January 14, 2029).The RBI said there is no notified amount against any of these securities within the aggregate ceiling of Rs 15,000 crore set for the operation.The Reserve Bank reserves the right to decide on the quantum of purchase of individual securities, accept offers for less than or higher than the aggregate amount of Rs 15,000 crore (including due to rounding off) and also to accept or reject any or all the offers either wholly or partially without assigning any reason.Earlier on Monday, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said the regulator has \"enough policy tools and stands ready to take any measures\" needed to help the economy tide over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.In two liquidity-enhancing measures, Das announced another round of $2 billion dollar-rupee swap on March 23, and in another measure, he said the RBI will continue to conduct the long-term repo operations (LTROs) of up to Rs 1 lakh crore as and when the market needs it.On March 16, the RBI conducted the first dollar-swap for $2 billion under which the central bank buys rupee from the market by selling dollars.On the LTROs, it has already conducted four rounds worth Rs 1 lakh crore operations since February 14, after announcing it at the February 6 policy review.OMOs are money market tools to suck or inject liquidity into the system.\n",

            "So, a lower position limit would automatically push scrips with high open interest into a ban.About 10-12% of the stocks, mostly volatile ones, traded in the futures and options segment will be impacted by Sebi's measures, according to Jimeet Modi founder of Mumbai-based Samco Securities.Sebi restricted the extent of short-selling of index derivatives by mutual funds, foreign portfolio investors and proprietary traders to their stock holdings.\n",

            "Summary : New Delhi: The Department of Telecom's plea seeking 20 years time for operators to pay adjusted gross revenue dues was approved by the Cabinet, Union minister Sanjay Dhotre informed Parliament.\n",
            "The Supreme Court will hear the government's rescue plan of giving telcos a 20-year repayment period for AGR dues during the next hearing scheduled after two weeks.\n",
            "\"Consequent to the approval by the Cabinet, an application has been moved before the Hon'ble Supreme Court on March 16, 2020, seeking, inter-alia, permission of the Hon'ble Court for the licensees impacted by the AGR judgement to pay the unpaid or remaining to be paid amount of past DoT assessed/calculated dues in annual instalments over 20 years duly protecting the net present value of the said dues using a discount rate of 8 per cent,\" the Minister of State for Communications told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply.The Supreme Court on Wednesday had lashed out at Bharti Airtel Vodafone Idea and other mobile phone operators for self-assessing their outstanding telecom dues, saying they need to pay past dues with interest and penalty -- an estimated amount of Rs 1.69 lakh crore.The apex court also came down heavily on the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for allowing companies to re-assess what they owed to the government, and said its order -- passed on October 24, 2019 -- on revenues for calculating dues was final.A bench of Justice Arun Mishra, Justice S A Nazeer and Justice M R Shah refused to take up the Centre's plea for allowing telecom companies to pay AGR dues in 20 years, saying the application will be taken up after two weeks.\n",
            "\"The time frame of 20 years is unreasonable.\n",
            "The telecom companies have to clear all dues mentioned in the judgement,\" the bench said, adding it had settled all AGR dues after hearing telecom companies and the government then had fought tooth and nail for interests and penalties.Bharti Airtel , Vodafone Idea and Tata Group's self-assessment of dues to the government are a whopping Rs 82,300 crore short of what the telecom department calculated after the Supreme Court's ruling on AGR.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), according to its own submission to the apex court seeking relief in payment tenure, has put dues of the three companies at Rs 1.19 lakh crore.The dues estimated by DoT for Bharti Airtel and Telenor was pegged at Rs 43,980 crore, while that of Vodafone Idea was Rs 58,254 crore, and Tata Group of companies at Rs 16,798 crore outlined under 'total demand of DoT incorporating CAG and special audit as on October 2019'.Against this, Bharti Group has calculated its dues at Rs 13,004 crore, Vodafone Idea at Rs 21,533 crore and Tata Group of companies at Rs 2,197 crore.In all, AGR dues calculated by the government for 16 entities add up to Rs 1.69 lakh crore, while telcos' self-assessment place their dues at a mere Rs 37,176 crore.These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.The bench said it will summon the secretary and desk officer of DoT who permitted telecom companies to do self-assessment of AGR dues.\n",

            "Once an emergency corpus is in place, they could restart their equity SIPs.Many first-time investors got carried away by the promise of higher return on equity and never really built an emergency corpus.Financial advisors said many first-time investors who started SIPs in the past four-five years did not do any holistic financial planning or heed the advice of maintaining an emergency corpus, focusing instead on investing in equity mutual funds to earn higher returns.“Since you have violated the basic rules of personal finance despite lucrative levels for equity, stop your SIPs over there to first build your emergency corpus using debt mutual funds ,” said Amol Joshi, founder, Plan Rupee.Many investors, including those who have placed bets on airlines, travel and tourism, are going through uncertain times.They now believe that they need to build an emergency fund as soon as possible.According to financial planners, every individual needs to have an emergency corpus which is equivalent to three-six months’ expenses, including repayment of loan instalments if any.An emergency fund can be in a bank account, bank deposit or a liquid or overnight fund that is not affected by market volatility and can be accessed easily in a day or two to help in any crisis, should individuals face a sudden dip in earnings from business or disruptions due to a shutdown in business or job.Such a corpus helps pay for children’s education, equated monthly instalments and usual household expenses.“If you have an equity mutual fund only portfolio, built through SIPs, you should use a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP) now to build an emergency fund so that you average your exit from equity as well,” said Vishal Dhawan, chief financial planner, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors.“Using an SWP investors can shift money from an equity fund to a debt fund that helps build their emergency corpus,” Dhawan added.Such investors should also stop or pause their equity mutual fund SIPs for a small period till this emergency corpus is built.Joshi believes once the corpus is ready, investors can go back and start their equity SIPs again.\n",

            "Summary : LONDON: European oil refineries are reducing operations as they face an unprecedented fall in fuel demand brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.In the United Kingdom , INEOS shut down a 35,000 barrels per day crude unit at its 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery on March 17, according to industry monitor Genscape.A source familiar with the plant's operations said the shutdown was related to deteriorating profit margins for fuels produced at a refinery including aviation and motor fuels.\n",
            "\"Horrendous margins and even worse physical markets,\" the source said when asked about the cause of the shutdown.A spokesman for the company declined to comment.With planes around the world being grounded, demand for jet fuel, once one of the biggest factors in oil demand growth, has fallen off a cliff, with prices for the fuel in Europe now at record lows.Refiners in Europe are producing gasoline at a loss.\n",
            "\"Refiners must cut runs now to manage the situation,\" consultants FGE said in a note.Oil major BP also shut down a 70,000 bpd crude unit at its Gelsenkirchen (Scholven) oil refinery in Germany on March 18, Genscape said.BP declined to comment.\n",
